Chicago Road Safety Alert System (CRSAS)


The Chicago Road Safety Alert System (CRSAS) is user centered software designed to protect drivers from hazardous road conditions in the city of Chicago. Our software safely alerts drivers when they enter a ZIP code associated with a higher number of hazards based on a criteria derived from complex data analysis. This criteria includes ZIP Codes, MPH, weekday, month, and traffic conditions which we found have the higher density of traffic accidents.


Data Sources:
The Chicago Road Safety Alert System uses modern, relevant data from the Chicago Data Portal to determine the most hazardous conditions. Our Data sources can be found here. 


The Team Contributions:
Our team divided the work into sections which allowed each team member to work towards their strengths and optimize our workflow. Each team member had a unique, and influential task.


        STEVEN E HAWORTH: Imported & reformatted massive dataset to improve readability. Conducted data analysis using statistical tools and visualization techniques to identify patterns and provide high-quality data for the team.


        YUWEI TANG: Implemented a visually appealing graphical user interface which alerts the user while simultaneously ensuring that they are not too distracted. Allowed the team's code to be visualized and interact with the user.


        XINYU ZHOU: Adjusted files to enhance their compatibility with map conversion and distance calculation based on latitude and longitude relative to the center of a zip code. Generated density map with user interaction


        AHNAF ABRAR KABIR: Performed Data Engineering, and trained multiple Machine Learning models and chose the best one using 5 fold cross validation, to identify probability of a costly hazardous event occurring based on zip codes in Chicago and provide support on merging all project components.


Conclusion: 
The Chicago Road Safety Alert System is imperative in improving our roads safety and identifying traffic hazards in the city of Chicago. This software can save lives and safely remind drivers of roadway hazards while unilaterally demonstrating to the city government where additional resources and funding must be allocated.
